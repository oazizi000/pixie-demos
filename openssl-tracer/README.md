# OpenSSL Tracer using BPF

This is a basic example of how to trace the OpenSSL library using eBPF.
This tracer uses BCC to deploy the eBPF probes.

## Prerequisites

You must have the BCC development package installed. On Ubuntu, the package can be installed as follows:


```
sudo apt install libbpfcc-dev
```

Other distributions have similar commands.

## Build

To compile, execute the following command:

```
make
```

## Run Demo Application

A demo application to trace is included. It is a simple client-server written in Python, which uses OpenSSL.

First, you'll have to generate some certificates for the client and server.
To keep things simple, you can generate some self-signed certificates as follows:

```
make -C ssl_client_server certs
```

To run the demo app, you'll need two terminals.

In one terminal, run the server:

```
cd ssl_client_server; ./server.py
```

In the second terminal, run the client:
```
cd ssl_client_server; ./client.py
```

## Run Tracer

The BPF tracer is run as follows:

```
sudo ./openssl_tracer <pid>
```

To run it on the demo app, run the following command in a separate terminal:
```
sudo ./openssl_tracer $(pgrep -f "./client.py")
```
